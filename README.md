# @nota/nativescript-webview-ext

Extended WebView for NativeScript which adds "x-local"-custom-scheme for loading local-files, handle events between WebView and NativeScript, JavaScript execution, injecting CSS and JS-files.
Supports Android 19+ and iOS9+.

## Features
* Adds a custom-scheme handler for x-local:// to the webview for loading of resources inside the webview.
    * Note: For iOS 11+ WKWebView is used, but for iOS <11 UIWebView is used
* Adds support for capturing URLs.
    *  This allows the app to open external links in an external browser and handle tel-links
* Added functions like:
    - `executeJavaScript(code: string)` for executing JavaScript-code and getting result.
    - `executePromise(code: string)` for calling promises and getting the result.
    - `getTitle()` returns document.title.
* Two-Way event listeners between `NativeScript` and `WebView`
    * From `NativeScript` to `WebView`
    * From `WebView` to `NativeScript`
* Adds functions to inject `css`- and `javascript`-files.
    * Into the current page.
    * Auto-injected on page load.
* Polyfills:
    * Promise
    * Fetch API (overrides Native API on Android to support x-local:// and file://)
* Allows `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt` with `WkWebView`.
* Supports:
    * Android 19+
    * iOS 9+

## Installation

Describe your plugin installation steps. Ideally it would be something like:

```bash
tns plugin add @nota/nativescript-webview-ext
```

### Angular support

Import `WebViewExtModule` from `@nota/nativescript-webview-ext/angular` and add it to your `NgModule`.

This registers the element `WebViewExt`. Replace the <WebView> tag with <WebViewExt>

### Vue support

Import `@nota/nativescript-webview-ext/vue` in your app entry file (likely app.js or main.js).

This registers the element `WebViewExt`. Replace the <WebView> tag with <WebViewExt>

## Usage

## Limitations

Custom scheme is only supported on iOS 11+.

iOS 11 added support for setting a `WKURLSchemeHandler` on the `WKWebView`.
Prior to iOS 11 there isn't support for intercepting the URL with `WKWebView` and `UIWebView` have been deprecated: [ITMS-90809](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/122114).

## API

| autoInjectJSBridge | true / false | Should the window.nsWebViewBridge be injected on `loadFinishedEvent`? Defaults to true |
| builtInZoomControls | true / false | Android: Is the built-in zoom mechanisms being used |
| cacheMode | default / no_cache / cache_first / cache_only | Android: Set caching mode. |
| databaseStorage | true / false | Android: Enable/Disabled database storage API. Note: It affects all webviews in the process. |
| debugMode | true / false | Android: Enable chrome debugger for webview on Android. Note: Applies to all webviews in App |
| displayZoomControls | true / false | Android: displays on-screen zoom controls when using the built-in zoom mechanisms |
| domStorage | true / false | Android: Enable/Disabled DOM Storage API. E.g localStorage |
| scrollBounce | true / false | iOS: Should the scrollView bounce? Defaults to true. |
| supportZoom | true / false | Android: should the webview support zoom |
| viewPortSize | false / view-port string / ViewPortProperties | Set the viewport metadata on load finished. **Note:** WkWebView sets initial-scale=1.0 by default. |

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| loadUrl(src: string): Promise<LoadFinishedEventData> | Open a URL and resolves a promise once it has finished loading. |
| registerLocalResource(resourceName: string, path: string): void; | Map the "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}". |
| unregisterLocalResource(resourceName: string): void; | Removes the mapping from "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}" |
| getRegisteredLocalResource(resourceName: string): void; | Get the mapping from "x-local://{resourceName}" => "{path}" |
| loadJavaScriptFile(scriptName: string, filepath: string) | Inject a javascript-file into the webview. Should be called after the `loadFinishedEvent` |
| loadStyleSheetFile(stylesheetName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore: boolean) | Loads a CSS-file into document.head. If before is true, it will be added to the top of document.head otherwise as the last element |
| loadJavaScriptFiles(files: {resourceName: string, filepath: string}[]) | Inject multiple javascript-files into the webview. Should be called after the `loadFinishedEvent` |
| loadStyleSheetFiles(files: {resourceName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore: boolean}[]) | Loads multiple CSS-files into the document.head. If before is true, it will be added to the top of document.head otherwise as the last element |
| autoLoadJavaScriptFile(resourceName: string, filepath: string) | Register a JavaScript-file to be injected on `loadFinishedEvent`. If a page is already loaded, the script will be injected into the current page. |
| autoLoadStyleSheetFile(resourceName: string, filepath: string, insertBefore?: boolean) | Register a CSS-file to be injected on `loadFinishedEvent`. If a page is already loaded, the CSS-file will be injected into the current page. |
| autoExecuteJavaScript(scriptCode: string, name: string) | Execute a script on `loadFinishedEvent`. The script can be a promise |
| executeJavaScript(scriptCode: string) | Execute JavaScript in the webpage. *Note:* scriptCode should be ES5 compatible, or it might not work on 'iOS < 11' |
| executePromise(scriptCode: string, timeout: number = 500) | Run a promise inside the webview. *Note:* Executing scriptCode must return a promise. |
| emitToWebView(eventName: string, data: any) | Emit an event to the webview. Note: data must be stringify'able with JSON.stringify or this throws an exception. |
| getTitle() | Returns a promise with the current document title. |

## Events
| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| loadFinished | Raised when a loadFinished event occurs. args is a `LoadFinishedEventData` |
| loadProgress | Android only: Raised during page load to indicate the progress. args is a `LoadProgressEventData` |
| loadStarted | Raised when a loadStarted event occurs. args is a `LoadStartedEventData` |
| shouldOverrideUrlLoading | Raised before the webview requests an URL. Can cancelled by setting args.cancel = true in the `ShouldOverrideUrlLoadEventData` |
| titleChanged | Document title changed |
| webAlert | Raised when `window.alert` is triggered inside the webview, needed to use custom dialogs for web alerts. args in a `WebAlertEventData`. `args.callback()` must be called to indicate alert is closed. |

| webConsole | Android only: Raised when a line is added to the web console. args is a `WebConsoleEventData`. |
| webPrompt | Raised when `window.prompt` is triggered inside the webview, needed to use custom dialogs for web prompt boxes. args in a `webConfirmEvent`. `args.callback(string | null)` must be called to indicate prompt box is closed. |
| Events emitted from the webview | Raised when nsWebViewBridge.emit(...) is called inside the webview. args in an `WebViewEventData` |

### WebView

Inside the WebView we have the `nsWebViewBridge` for sending events between the `NativeScript`-layer and the `WebView`.
**Note:** The bridge will only be available `DOMContentLoaded` or `onload` inside the WebView.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.on(eventName: string, cb: (data: any) => void) | Registers handlers for events from the native layer. |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.off(eventName: string, cb?: (data: any) => void) | Unregister handlers for events from the native layer. |
| window.nsWebViewBridge.emit(eventName: string, data: any) | Emits event to NativeScript layer. Will be emitted on the WebViewExt as any other event, data will be a part of the WebViewEventData-object |
